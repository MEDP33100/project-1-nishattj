# MEDP 33100 Project 1: Interactive Storytelling

## Project Overview

"The Artifact of Time" is an interactive story where Lena, an archaeologist discovers a mysterious tunnel. Inside, she encounteres some obstacles, leading her to the Artifact of Time which can alter the past and change the course of history. The story leads to a different ending based on the users choice. The key interactive element are the buttons in this story.

## Figma Design

I wanted my pages to be simple in the way that there aren't too many elements. For my layout I decided to have an image for the background along with animations and buttons. Each button leads to the same layout format. 

## Features

- List the key features of the project, including:
    - **Animations**: Describe the animations you implemented (e.g., CSS transitions, GSAP effects).
    Emoji Animation I used goes subtly up-and-down using GSAP.
    Arrow Rotation are the two clock arrows on each side of the screen rotating 360 degrees in a continuous loop.
    Slide-In Button slide into the screen with a @keyframes animation.
    Fade-In Text gradually fades in the text using a fadeIn animation. 

    - **Sound Effects**: Specify where sound effects are used and how they enhance the user experience.
    Clock Ticking and Footsteps are the two sounds that are in a loop and are triggered when the user clicks the "Start" button, enhancing user experience.

    - **User-triggered Events**: Explain how users interact with the page (e.g., clicking, scrolling, hovering) and how the page responds.
    Choice Selection by the user leads to different story path.
    Clicking the Start button triggers sound effects and shows the first set of choices.
    Hover Effects is used on the buttons when hovered over the color changes.

    - **Responsive Design**: Explain how the design adapts to different devices (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).
     To achieve a responsive design, I used several techniques like flexible layout and vw units for font and button sizes. This ensures that the text and buttons are scaled proportionally across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- List the technologies and tools used in the project:
    - Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - Libraries: GSAP for animations
    - Other: GitHub Pages for hosting and Figma for design

## Future Enhancements

- Adding more choices and branches to make the story more complex
- Enhancing the visuals with more detailed images or 3D models
